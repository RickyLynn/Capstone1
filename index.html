    <h2>About me:</h2> 
        <p>I am Rick Porier. A professional photographer and entrepeneur from the Dallas Metroplex in Texas.
            I am currently learning everything I can in coding and Artificial Intelligence to compliment
            the long-list of skills that I already have. 
        </p>

    <h2>My Outlook:</h2>
        <p>My mission is to continually learn and evolve my skills to keep up with trends in technology
            and the market. Some peoplle (especially creatives like myself) are afraid of how the growth
            of A.I. will impact their career, not me. I am excited about it and embrace what it can do
            and the potential that it holds. The opportunities this new technology and skills knowledge
            that I am learning seem to have almost limitless potential.
        </p>
